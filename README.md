## Site template

A pretty dynamic template for a professional page to be hosted on Heroku (for people who aren't *really* developers). I built this for my sister when she decided she needed a professional site.

To create your own site, fork this repo, hook it up to heroku, add the mLab add-on, set a PASSWORD environment variable and PORT environment variable (5000 is fine).

Then you can edit blog pages at your-site.com/edit and edit the whole site at your-site.com/edit-me
